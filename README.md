# Doc-Chatter

## About

Doc-Chatter project is a copy/fork made by following this [youtube video tutorial](https://youtu.be/ucX2zXAZ1I0). It was made by an awesome young fella [Josh tried coding](https://www.youtube.com/@joshtriedcoding). Go check him out and subscribe to his channel.

I'm doing this just to try out my new neovim setup and maybe change a thing or two to my liking while I'm at it. Maybe something useful comes out of this in the end :)

## Running the app

First install all the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Run the development server by executing one of the following commands.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
